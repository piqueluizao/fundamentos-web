        Harry Potter is an orphan boy who lives unhappily with his uncles, the
        Dursleys. He receives a letter containing an invitation to join
        Hogwarts, a famous school specializing in training young wizards.
        Initially, Harry is prevented from reading the letter by his uncle, but
        he is soon visited by Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, who arrives to
        take him to the school. Harry enters a magical world he never imagined,
        living several adventures with his new friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione
        Granger.

        After a miserable vacation at his aunt and uncle's house, Harry Potter
        prepares to return to Hogwarts and begin his second year at wizarding
        school. The day before school starts, the strange creature Dobby appears
        in his room and warns him that coming back is a mistake and that
        something very bad could happen if Harry insists on continuing his
        studies of witchcraft. The boy, however, is willing to take the risk and
        get rid of the troubled home.

        It's the beginning of the third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft.
        Harry, Ron and Hermione have a lot to learn. But a threat haunts the
        school and it's called Sirius Black. After twelve years incarcerated in
        Azkaban Prison, he manages to escape and returns to avenge his master,
        Lord Voldemort. To make matters worse, the Dementors, guards supposedly
        sent to protect Hogwarts and follow in Black's footsteps, appear to be
        even more dangerous threats.

        Harry returns for his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
        Wizardry, along with his friends Ron and Hermione. This time, there is a
        tournament between the three major schools of magic, with one
        participant selected from each school, by the Goblet of Fire. Harry's
        name pops up, even though he hasn't applied, and he has to compete.

        After a disastrous summer, Harry returns to his fifth year at Hogwarts,
        one of the most difficult he will have to face. Very few students and
        parents believe him or Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, and an
        endless series of articles circulates saying that they are completely
        nuts. To top it off, Dolores Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark
        Arts teacher, proves to be the most disgusting person Harry has ever
        met.

        strives to carry out an action intended by Voldemort, while Dumbledore
